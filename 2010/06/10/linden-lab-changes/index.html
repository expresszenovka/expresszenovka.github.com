  </header><p>The main reason I didn't work on this post yesterday was that I was
too busy trying to savor what was left of my rez day. Now I'll try
to make heads and tails of <a href="http://j.mp/d71fYN">M's blogpost from yesterday</a> and the
related <a href="http://j.mp/9MDPCI">press release</a>.</p>

<h2>High Level</h2>

<p>The blog post states the following main goals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>to improve our focus as a company on the projects that matter
  most to Residents</li>
  <li>to simplify our organizational structure and
  operate more efficiently</li>
  <li>to achieve cost savings so that we can
  invest in platform improvements, new products, and new lines of
  business.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter two goals make a decent amount of business sense --
audit and assess the company, trim the fat, and stretch the money
available. Something like what the Bob's did at Initech. While not
always fun for employees, if done correctly this kind of move is
generally better for the long terms goals for any company.</p>

<p>The press release goes into more detail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The company's product and engineering divisions will be combined.
  The software development teams will be consolidated in North
  America and customer support will be reconfigured to provide more
  scalable services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Support restructuring should hopefully be a welcome improvement.
I've heard quite a few complaints and horror stories about dealing
with support since the last time they reconfigured. While the
original support team was great, it just couldn't handle the
necessary volume of tickets. Apparently the original reworking
wasn't great and couldn't handle the volume either. Let's hope this
third try is a charm.</p>

<p>As for the software team consolidation, that also makes decent
sense. Having all your developers within 3 time zones of each other
definitely helps with interoffice communication. As for merging
engineering and product teams -- I'm guessing that means IT
infrastructure and software (server and client) are now the same
team. Which means a lot of sense considering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, the company aims to create a browser-based virtual world
  experience, eliminating the need to download software. Secondly,
  Linden Lab will look to extend the Second Life experience into
  popular social networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When your client is in the browser being served from the hardware
and interacting with the server software -- being in the same team
makes decent sense.</p>

<h2>Those Laid Off</h2>

<p>The unfortunate part, though, is the "trimming of fat". The press
release claims30% of the company got laid off yesterday. This is
supposedly <a href="http://j.mp/chlfks">the list of Lindens who were laid off yesterday</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure of the list's accuracy, since it's originally
from March 30, 2009, but it looks like at least 40 Lindens were let
go yesterday. Being laid off is almost never a happy event, and I
hope everyone that last their job yesterday will find be able to
find new employment soon.</p>

<p>My question, though, is why were those Lindens laid off.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://j.mp/drUMoO">Massively</a>, the enterprise team, the Singapore
office, and German country/community manager Katrin Linden were
part of yesterday's cut. That all falls in line with M's plans. SL
Enterprise solutions have generally been a failed venture and
aren't necessary if focus is returning to improving resident
experience. Singapore isn't North America, unfortunately, so the
team there was let go. Losing the German manager doesn't fit very
cleanly, but I'm guessing that for some reason the European HQ in
Amsterdam (which for some reason isn't listed on their
<a href="http://lindenlab.com/employment">employment page</a>) somehow made her redundant.</p>

<p>But not all of the names make much sense. I didn't know any of the
Lindens personally and most of my knowledge of their work comes
from official blog posts and JIRA. The following names (in
alphabetical order) make me ask questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Babbage - Babbage was supposed to fix a handful of Mono-related
bugs, including an upgrade to later Mono that would fix
<a href="https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SVC-3895">SVC-3895</a>. Without him on the team, what will happen to
LSL-Mono, and LSL in general. Will he be replaced by developerss who will
work on Unity3D (basically Mono in a browser)?</li>
<li>Blue - Blue, along with other Lindens who worked with the Teen
Grid (Claudia, Teagan, and Mia come to mind -- others probably as
well) were on the list. Does this mean that the Teen Grid is going
soon as well? Maybe their positions will be replaced in the
upcoming support restructuring?</li>
<li>Pink - the new SL Beta Marketplace was supposed to launch last
night. I'm guessing that'll come soon, but it'd seem that Pink was
hired only as a freelancer/consultant then?</li>
<li>Pastrami - One of the original Windlight devs, Pastrami was
supposedly working on mesh import lately. Does that mean mesh
import is done or on the blocks for now? Mesh import was among the
list of <a href="http://j.mp/9z8okS">upcoming features for this year</a>.</li>
<li>Whump - Since Whump was the OpenSimulator interoperability dev,
I guess inter-grid movement is no longer even a distant goal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p>I'm on the fence about the new Linden Lab goals. Running SL in a
browser as opposed to as a downloadable program is a laudable goal.
Sure, AjaxLife has been around for a few years, but i'm guessing
this is a full 3D viewer in the browser. If it's possible, it would
make it a lot easier to get in world from anywhere. Maybe even from
an iPad or netbook. But browsers implement plugin APIs slightly
different, leading to hacks and strange limitations. Which browsers
will LL decide to support, and on which platforms? On the plus side
though, the new Version 2.0 interface now make a lot of sense -- it
looks like a browser because it will eventually be in a browser.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure I like the focus on social networks though. It
doesn't matter to me that SL interacts with social networking
tools. I can already plurk and tweet inworld. I already have a
profile on secondlife.com. Facebook doesn't want avatars, while I'm
not sure I want Avatars United. So why this emphasis on integrating
with social networks? It doesn't make sense that doing so would
make SL more mainstream. While the social networking space is
volatile (anyone like Friendster or Myspace anymore?), what does SL
bring to the table that would make the mainstream user want it? Is
the new Second Life really just a Facebook clone with a 3D world on
the side? That doesn't seem right.</p>

<p>And what about all the goals that were on the books and seemingly
aren't anymore? Marketplace beta was due today, Server 1.40 and
Havok 7 were due this summer, and mesh import was due for end of
year. Are those deadlines slipping? Will they actually be
completed? Viewer 2.1 alpha was released today, so it'd seem that
project is still on track, but doesn't say much about all of the
other projects.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, though, Second Life is still about the people.
Linden Lab provides the glue that allows me to keep in touch with
those people, but there are other mechanisms too. Day to day SL
shouldn't change that much. And if it does change enough that
people find it unusable, they'll either move to another platform or
give up. Sure the next platform might not be as good as Second
Life, but people will adjust in order to hang out with their
friends.</p>
