  </header><p>A little epic sounding, especially if you're not actually closing. And it's basically the first store-wide sale (there were some Christmas freebies, if I remember correctly). But that is what it's called. I expect the feeds will be full of Armidi starting oh.. right about now... and the posts will be full of reminiscing and stories about how hard is to get into the sale sims.</p>

<p>So I'm going to talk about it from a slightly different viewpoint. When Armidi first opened, back in late 2007, it was after a good six months of teasing the public. Anyone remember the Poynter from Hair Fair 2007? The Armidi team stole the show. It was great hair, for the time, but everyone and their mother, father, ex, ex's ex, and ex's mother's father's dog had at least one style and wore it all the time. Once the sim opened, the same thing happened to all of their products, creating the Armidi stigma. Even if the designers create some of the highest quality products on the grid, the products are mainstream because "everyone" has them and thus they unfortunately become passe.</p>

<p>I, for one, avoided Armidi since I believed the prices were exorbitantly high. Why should I spend luxury prices on mainstream clothes? It didn't help that new releases were few and far between, always "fashionably late." It left a bad taste in the mouth.</p>

<p>Fast forward 3 years to the present. Armidi is still around, the sim is still laggy as ever and really hasn't changed much for a good while. Certain sections of Armidi are horribly out of date while other sections are no longer fashionable. A handful of stores have achieved and surpassed the quality of Armidi wares and offer these newer clothes at much more reasonable prices.</p>

<p>At least for women.</p>

<p>I doubt there ever will be as much selection and variety in male clothing as there is for women, nor do I ever expect there to be. As a result, though, there are very few stores that can match the quality of the Armidi basics for guys. Even worse (for me at least), very little of the quality new items for men have been in my style, which I'll readily admit is on the bland side.</p>

<p>So, as guilty as it makes me feel to admit it -- I was pretty excited for the Armidi sale. With everything at nearly 50% off, the Armidi clothes that I've liked for years, which happen to fit my style, are now at a reasonable price point. It's like having my cake and eating it too.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I do feel a bit guilty about spending as much as I did, especially on items "tainted" by the Armidi stigma. At the end of the day, though, you have to do what makes you happy. I've waited nearly three years for this. I know I'll use the jackets, tees, and jeans I just bought. And while my outfits may be a bit repetitive, the bottom line is that I still feel pretty damn good wearing em.</p>
