  </header><p>Times are a'changing in the world of SL viewers. Many people are
searching for a new viewer, desperately trying various ones before
throwing their hands up into the air and blaming Linden Lab for
everything. Quite a few folks have written guides to help those
displaced residents find a new viewer. Hey, I even started one, but
then I got bored.
So I figured instead of a giant viewer vs viewer post I'd mention
something most folks seem to forget:
<em>Linden Lab had made and currently supports more than one viewer.</em></p>

<p>You might be staring slack-jawed wondering why I'm recommending
something from Linden Lab. So I'll enumerate my reasons briefly and
then expand on them a bit later.</p>

<ol>
<li>Linden Lab makes Second Life.</li>
</ol>

<p>No really. That's about it.</p>

<h2>The Goods</h2>

<p>Of course, you can get Viewer 2. That one's easy:
<a href="http://get.secondlife.com">get.secondlife.com</a>.</p>

<p>Linden Lab still supports Viewer 1.x as well, at least for now. If
you want <em>any</em> older official release just go to
<a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Old_versions">the old versions page</a> on the wiki. One caveat, though, is that
older releases may have security flaws and issues connecting to the
grid. Also (imho) the official Viewer 1.x is just about the worst
option out there for viewers nowadays.</p>

<p>The reason why it sucks is <a href="http://snowglobeproject.org/">Snowglobe</a>. Amongst other things,
Snowglobe made it easier to submit, commit, and test patches that
might eventually end up in the core viewer. So Snowglobe viewers
have everything the regular viewers have plus a few extra features
that havent't been as thoroughly tested.</p>

<p>Snowglobe is available in both <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Snowglobe">1.x and 2.x flavors</a>, and still
seems to be going under active development (albeit at a somewhat
slower pace than last year).</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the Lab recently announced
<a href="http://blogs.secondlife.com/community/technology/blog/2010/08/16/project-snowstorm-our-new-open-development-program">Project Snowstorm</a>. Snowstorm seems to be very much like a
Snowglobe 2.0, for Viewer 2.x, taking the best parts of the
Snowglobe project and reworking the bits that didn't work. There's
already been dev builds released from Snowstorm but I haven't tried
them since they are dev/alpha builds.</p>

<h2>The Pros</h2>

<p>Snowglobe rezzes faster. This probably has to do with getting
textures using http, but I'm not sure. Before Viewer 2, Snowglobe
1.x was my preferred viewer purely for its speed. The extra
features were just icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Linden Lab open-sourced their viewer code. This allowed people to
improve and extend the viewer. In fact,
<a href="http://svn.secondlife.com/trac/linden/browser/trunk/doc/contributions.txt">a good number of JIRA tickets were closed thanks to contributions from residents based on that open code</a>.
Despite that, most of the code in both the official viewers and
thirty party viewers (based on the opensourced viewer code) was
written by a Linden. So it has to be a pretty good base.</p>

<p>Related to that, Linden Lab doesn't have the resources to code check
every line in a third party viewer. The <a href="http://viewerdirectory.secondlife.com/">Viewer Directory</a> is
"self-certified", meaning the <em>developers</em> are attesting that their
viewer is TOS/TPV compliant. The onus of determining each viewer's
safety is on the resident, not Linden Lab. You can download
hundreds of applications (legally and illegally) from the internet,
and just about every one of those apps could potentially contain
viruses, trojans, spyware, etc. Even if you have the latest
antivirus definitions and malware detection, would those tools be
able to tell the difference between an encrypted packet being sent
to Linden Lab and an encrypted packet going some shady developer's
server?</p>

<p>I'm not trying to spread FUD about third party viewers -- they just
require a bit more research to make sure they are safe. Regardless
of your operating system, you as the user are the first line of
defense for your computer. Assuming you trust Linden Lab (because
you want to be on their grid), they're probably the safest place to
get a Second Life viewer. For lack of a better analogy coming to
mind, using an LL viewer is kinda like abstinence instead of using
a contraceptive.</p>

<h2>The Cons</h2>

<p>The older official viewer is, as mentioned above, probably the
lamest viewer around -- third party viewers included. That's
because its sort of the "lowest common denominator" for all
viewers. Every other viewer has its features and it has nothing on
them. That's why you'll probably want to pick one of the other
options from the Lab.</p>

<p>In general, though, viewers from Linden Lab are designed for the
widest user base, leading to fewer optimizations. For
example, the viewer is able to run on Pentium III processors, so it
is not compiled with SSE2 support (which would make 3D computations
marginally faster). Most of these kinds of computational advantages
are barely noticeable in day to day usage, though, so I don't
consider that a very large con.</p>

<p>What few optimizations are in place lead to "exclusion" of a
section of the market. The best example I can think of is the way
Second Life has favored NVIDIA graphics cards over ATI graphics
cards. I don't know if Linden Lab actually had some sort of
exclusion agreement in place with NVIDIA, but at the end of the day
their favoring NVIDIA often leaves ATI users feeling left out and
frustrated by the official viewers, especially since ATI has
enjoyed a resurgence in popularity these last few years.</p>

<p>The fault, however, is not completely Linden Lab's. Linden Lab
relies on OpenGL, a cross-language, cross-platform API for computer
graphics. ATI didn't implement OpenGL very well in the past, so it
made sense to optimize for NVIDIA. Now that ATI has (to some
extent) caught up, it would probably be nice to see feature parity
between the two vendors. Maybe that's why shadows are still in
alpha?</p>

<p>The biggest con, however, is that development of the official
viewer is a slow moving beast. The Lab's QA cycle is long, and new
features and improvements take a while to roll out. That's where I
see Snowglobe/storm stepping in to pick up the pace.</p>

<h2>In the End</h2>

<p>I use Viewer 2.1 as my main viewer. It works well enough for my
needs on my two computers. Both of my machines were purchased with
Second Life in mind, so I did my best to make sure I had hardware
that worked. For me, that meant getting mid to high end NVIDIA
graphics cards (8600M GT &amp; GTX 260) and having at least 4GB of
system RAM. I generally run Medium graphics on my laptop and Ultra
on my desktop. Thus far, I haven't crashed very often (maybe once
or twice a month?)</p>

<p>Once Snowstorm brings Snowglobe 2.x up to parity with Viewer 2.1
and Snowglobe 1.4, I 'll probably switch to that. Linden Lab has
made it clear the future is Viewer 2.x and to be honest, I kinda
like the interface.</p>

<p>If I ever need a version 1.x Viewer, I go back to Snowglobe. Sure,
I may be missing a few fancy bells and whistles from third party
viewers, but I almost never need them so I didn't mind. When I do,
I use the viewer with the feature I need.</p>

<p>As always, your mileage may vary. Just don't discount any viewers
on account of their coming from the Lab.</p>
