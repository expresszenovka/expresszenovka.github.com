  </header><p>I like OpenSimulator but grids running on
OpenSimulator aren't for me.<!--more--></p>

<h2>OpenSimulator is Cool</h2>

<p>That might seem contradictory at first. If you like OpenSimulator,
why wouldn't you like OpenSimulator grids? The answer is quite
simple -- I like the ideas and goals of <a href="http://opensimulator.org/">OpenSimulator</a>. I like
the potential, and I like the innovation. In fact, I installed
OpenSimulator on my desktop within minutes of finding the project and
remember grinning like an idiot standing there ruthed on my own
standalone sim. In fact, I'll probably make a quick post about how
to set up your own standalone OpenSimulator soon.</p>

<p>But notice that I said a standalone sim. That means that I was
running a 1x1 grid of my own, managing (amongst other things) the
list of users, the assets, messaging between users, and of course
the simulator region all on the same machine. When you connect an
OpenSimulator region to a grid, you rely on the userlist, assets,
messaging system, and grid management provided by the grid's host.
When <a href="http://www.osgrid.org/elgg/pg/utilities/connect">connecting a region to OSGrid</a>, for example, you use
osgrid.org to provide that functionality.</p>

<h2>Who is Accountable?</h2>

<p>And there-in lies my problem. I need to trust the grid owner to
keep my content safe and not misuse it. If a grid owner
accidentally sets up their asset server without enough protection,
or a grid owner purposefully opens up security on certain assets,
the content is free game. Or hey, what if the owner decides to just
log in as me, give half of my inventory full perms to a random
account, then wipe it from the logs?</p>

<p>If that happened in SL, I could hold Linden Lab responsible. But
who can I hold accountable for an OpenSimulator grid? You can't
hold the OpenSimulator project responsible, due to their
<a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Contributions_Policy">licensing policy</a>. The grid owners, perhaps? Lets try to figure
out who that is for OSGrid. I don't want to pick on them, but they
claim to be the largest OpenSimulator grid on their front page and
according to <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Grid_List/OSGrid">the OpenSimulator wiki</a> they are the second oldest.
If the OSGrid team can't be found or held responsible in any way,
how could I expect to track down a smaller and less known grid's
owner?</p>

<p>As a start, OSGrid Inc. is a California non-profit organization. So
there must be a board of directors of some sort, but I'm not sure
where to find that. On top of that, the <a href="http://www.osgrid.org/elgg/pg/expages/read/Terms/">Terms of Service</a>,
<a href="http://www.osgrid.org/elgg/pg/expages/read/About/">About</a>, and <a href="http://www.osgrid.org/elgg/pg/expages/read/Privacy/">Privacy</a> pages are all empty. For the record,
they were that way when I checked three months ago (mid June 2010)
as well. My next step would be to check a <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/osgrid.org">who-is</a>, which came up
with a name. A quick google check verified that he was indeed the
guy behind OSGrid.</p>

<p>The thing is, I was able to find a name to pin after a bit of
searching. But what if a hypothetical grid owner covered his
tracks, living outside the US and hiding his domain information.
*If* I were able to find proof that he had misused my content,
how would I track him down? Linden Lab has a lot to lose if this
sort of scandal erupted -- whether or not LL actually did it. But
this grid owner can just up and walk away.</p>

<h2>Paranoia?</h2>

<p>You might say I'm being paranoid. That no grid owner has stolen
information yet. Does anyone remember Legend City Online? LCO was a
grid that popped up in late 2008, back when the Lab announced the
sim price hike and few other unpleasant changes. Many words were
said about how great and how awful LCO was, how it would scare LL
as worthy competition and how it would relieve LL by proving
OpenSim grids aren't competition.</p>

<p>Well, the owner of Legend City Online
<a href="http://secondthoughts.typepad.com/second_thoughts/2008/12/sl-legend-simone-locked-out-of-legend-city-online.html">supposedly banned Simone Stern (of Simone! Design) because of a dispute over a contract</a>!
As a side note, yes I did just link to Prok. Regardless, it is
conceivable to locked out and seperated from your content in Second
Life as well, but a Linden could not take your data and move it
elsewhere. A third party grid owner could take your content and
move it to SL.</p>

<h2>So You Don't Like OpenSimulator?</h2>

<p>I like OpenSimulator a lot. As an open source alternative to Linden
Lab's grid and simulator software, it provides Second Life-like
functionality to people who don't want to be constrained by Linden
Lab or connected to the rest of the Second Life grid. And of top of
that, usage is free. That makes it perfect for most academic and
corporate use.</p>

<p>OpenSimulator is also good for personal use. Designers and builders
can work in the privacy of their own space, creating backups
whenever they want, and then export and import into Second Life
when they are done.</p>

<p>In fact, to the average, residential Second Life user, an
OpenSimulator grid could be a viable alternative to Second Life.
Sure, the software is not as stable, and all of the latest and
greatest from Second Life might not be available.</p>

<p>But, as a content creator, I am not sure I can trust a third party
grid owner. Linden Lab, as a corporation, can barely protect my
intellectual property and does so simply because it must. Will I
receive the same protection, if any, from a grid run by a few
individuals in their spare time? Could I accidentally give up all of
my creations full perm by teleporting to rogue sim run by a
hacker?</p>

<p>To be honest, IP is not really the issue. The bigger concern is
whether or not someone else can use my IP and gain revenue at my
expense. If I were just donating my skills and work, not expecting
any revenue, OpenSimulator would be wonderful and amazing. But as
long as I want to derive income from my work, OpenSimulator is
worrisome to me.</p>

<h2>Linden Lab Isn't So Bad</h2>

<p>OpenSimulator offers many configuration options. Not just how a
given simulator is configured, but even the grids themselves. There
are multiple options for voice servers and money/transaction
servers. While this flexibility is good for grid owners, it
provides more unknowns for me as a content creator. In contrast,
Linden Lab's walled garden provides a sort of comfort that is
appealing.</p>

<p>We all know how well that walled garden attitude worked for AOL,
but Second Life is not the same as the internet. Maybe, in a few
years, when a "Second Life" protocol is put forth that binds Linden
Lab and all other simulator software, which has content security
built in from the ground up, then I'll trust OpenSimulator grids.
But until then, those grids are as appealing as a sketchy site that
tells me that my Linux based laptop needs to run their
VirusScan.exe.</p>
