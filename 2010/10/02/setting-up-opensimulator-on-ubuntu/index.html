  </header><p>I'm not a third party grid fan, I but I do like the ability to have
my own sandbox sim. I can build or try to make content here,
exporting backups as I work. When I'm done I can just export the
final version and import it to Second Life. Figured I'd share how I
set this all up for those who want a similar
sandbox.</p>

<p>I used a fresh install of the
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/server">32bit server edition of Ubuntu 10.04.1</a>. I used 32bit since I am
actually running OpenSimulator in a virtual machine with only 2GB
of memory. No need for 64bit with that little memory. Also,
OpenSimulator has (had?) a few issues with 64bit hardware so I
figured I could sidestep those. If you want to install in a VM as
well, try using <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and make sure you set up a VM to use
bridged networking or host-only networking so it has its own
discrete IP for access.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to change my APT settings so that I don't
install suggested or required packages. Suggested packages are
sometimes useful, but I find that recommended packages are often
unecessary. I actually make this change on every Debian-based
machine I run.</p>

<p>So I added an extra file <code>11lean</code> to <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/</code>:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
// Recommends are as of now still abused in many packages
APT::Install-Recommends "0";
APT::Install-Suggests "0";`
</pre>

<p>I decided to compile myself, just to see what it was like.
Surprisingly, it wasn't actually that difficult nor long, even in a
virtual machine. However, if compiling isn't your cup of tea you
can grab various binaries from <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Download">their official download page</a>.
The official download page also has links to third party builds so
you can install the whole thing via apt if you want.</p>

<p>Before I built I needed the prerequisites.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
sudo aptitude install git-core nant libmono-system-runtime2.0-cil \
libmono-microsoft8.0-cil
</pre>

<p>Git is not necessary, but the project uses a <a href="http://opensimulator.org/viewgit/?a=summary&amp;p=opensim">git repository</a>. If
you ever want to install the latest source you can use</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
git clone git://opensimulator.org/git/opensim
</pre>

<p>But, the wiki says not to use the head revision since they can be
unstable. So I used the latest source release instead. For the
record, I probably should have used <code>/usr/src/local</code> but I was lazy
and did all this from my user's home directory.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
wget http://dist.opensimulator.org/opensim-0.7.0.2-source.tar.gz
tar xzf opensim-0.7.0.2-source.tar.gz
cd opensim-0.7.0.2-source/
./runprebuild.sh
nant
</pre>

<p>And that was it. Had no errors while building. Before running I
made a few changes.</p>

<p>First I installed mysql (to use that instead of sqlite) because
that's easy enough to do.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
sudo aptitude install mysql-server
</pre>

<p>Then I ran mysql and created a db for OpenSimulator. Make sure you
actually choose your own password for the user</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
mysql -u root -p -h localhost
mysql> create database opensim;
mysql> use opensim;
mysql> create user 'opensim'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
mysql> grant all on *.* to 'opensim'@'localhost';
mysql> quit
</pre>

<p>Then I had to set up a few configuration files.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
cd bin/
cp OpenSim.ini.example OpenSim.ini
</pre>

<p>Inside OpenSim.ini I commented out the sqlite lines with a ';' and
uncommented the mySQL lines. I also set the password I chose above
in the connection line. Turns out there's a separate config file
for standalones, so I changed similar lines in that file too.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
cp config-include/StandaloneCommon.ini.example config-include/StandaloneCommon.ini
</pre>

<p>Finally, I installed screen so I could "hide away" the process in a
lazy way and finally ran the thing.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
sudo aptitude install screen
screen
mono OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe
</pre>

<p>When I ran that for the first time, it asked me a few things about
the region and my first avatar. It all worked and it said the
region was up.</p>

<p>Next up was accessing the sim. I used <a href="http://imprudenceviewer.org/">Imprudence</a>, my current
(and long-time) favorite third party viewer. I don't use TPVs
often, but when I do I use Imprudence.</p>

<p>Had I set this up on my Linux desktop, I could have used the
localhost grid but since I have a dedicated VM, I had to set up my
own grid entry in the grid manager. Login is on port 9000 by
default, so it was just http://test-vm-ip:9000. Selected my grid,
entered the avatar name and password, and voila:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/expresszenovka/5043866714/" title="OpenSimulator Test by expresszenovka, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5043866714_d540f2a802.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="OpenSimulator Test" /></a></p>

<p>Look at that Ruth.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer: I'm not an OpenSimulator developer, and what
worked for me might not work for you. I probably can't help you set
up OpenSimulator - I used a combination of google and the official
wiki to do what I did. I've never set up a third party grid, nor do
I plan to anytime soon. I also have never set up OpenSimulator on
Windows and the only time I tried on OS X I used a pre-packaged dmg
from the download page.</p>

<p>Suggestions and improvements to this guide are definitely welcome,
though this quick and dirty install worked just fine for me.</p>
