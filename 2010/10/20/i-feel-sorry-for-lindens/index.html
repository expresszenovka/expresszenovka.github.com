  </header><p>I really do. Because we, as a community, treat them like shit.</p>

<p>We want others to treat us like human beings. We remind them that
there is a human on the other side of the internet, a real living
human being with emotions an want others to treat us with at least
some bit of decency as a result.</p>

<p>But when it comes to Lindens, somehow the same rule doesn't apply.
We hold them to different standards. Every Linden, regardless of
their position, occupation, and expertise, is responsible for
making sure all of Second Life works perfectly the exact way we
want it to. We want that Linden in customer service to switch
everything back to Viewer 1.x as much as we expect that Linden who
works on inworld rendering to fix search so that our store is the
first result in search (as opposed to every other store that wants
to be first).</p>

<p>How often have you heard that "Linden Lab can't do _______
right?" Every little thing from grid stability to which features
are implemented in the viewer to whether or not a Linden can dress
themselves -- the universal assumption is that Linden Lab is slow,
bumbling, and inept. Never mind the fact that they, you know,
created this huge virtual world that many of like to use daily. How
has SL survived as long as it has while so many "Second Life
killers" have failed? Because nobody else has been able to do it
better yet.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is: Linden Lab has made a lot of good stuff
and done a lot of hard work. Without LL, there would be no SL. If
it were easy to make a virtual world that supports as many users
and does as much as SL, all of those competitors would have
succeeded. OpenSimulator came about by reverse engineering Second
Life -- yes its a clean room and yes it has lots of fancy things
that SL doesn't -- but it wouldn't have come about on its own.
Similarly, most of the popular third party viewers are based on
code from Linden Lab.</p>

<p>Is the Lab perfect? Of course not, but they're human. Yes, they've
taken missteps and made mistakes. And yes, some of their decisions
may not have been so popular. Linden Lab is a business. They must
do what the board of directors wants. They have to abide by the
laws of the countries they reside in. And (arguably) more
importantly, they must make a profit in order to continue their
growth.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, though, every Linden is a regular human,
just like you and me. Do you really think Lindens are going out of
their way to make you crash? That they're going out of their way to
cripple their own virtual world? That they have so little pride in
their work that everything they put out is half-assed crap? What
may seem like a little feature may have taken months it implement.
And of course, like any other humans, they can make mistakes. In
time, they often attempt to rectify their mistakes as well.</p>

<p>So next time you curse at the Lab or deride any given Linden, try
to take a walk in their shoes. You just spent the last few months
pouring your heart and soul into a project that will be inspected,
critiqued, and ridiculed for everything from cosmetic issues to the
technology it runs on. Much of your user base, despite clamoring
for the project's completion, will resist using it because it is
not what they are used to. A portion of those that do test your
project will try it within the first 24 hours after beta release,
find a flaw or experience an incompatibility, and then join that
group of naysayers who decry the project. On top of that, they
won't report the issue in the bug tracker, leaving you in the dark
as they spread word of the issue to their friends and social
network. A smaller portion of extremely vocal opponents will claim
they could do it better, citing their degree in something or
another that is comparable to your degree. They'll say that if you
truly knew what you were doing the product would have had x, y, and
z, all features that are in the pipeline but were deemed not quite
stable enough for the first public launch. And every time you fix
something, they'll criticize the architecture of your product and
demand you start the entire project from scratch.</p>

<p>It's a thankless job, and nobody has to do it for us.</p>
