  </header><p>Linden Lab has rolled out the new username system this week. What
does that mean for you? Probably not that much, but I'll tell you
what I've found out with the hope that it'll offer some clarity.</p>

<h2>What are Usernames?</h2>

<p>There are now two types of accounts in Second Life -- new accounts
and legacy accounts. Those of us who were on the grid before the
new naming system are legacy accounts. We chose two names, and we
get to keep them. Our usernames are created by putting our two
names together with a period. The new accounts are, well, new. New
accounts choose only one name, which is their username.</p>

<p>There's a few different ways to format names, so here's a little
table stolen shamelessly from the <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Category:LSL_Avatar/Name">the SL wiki</a>.</p>

<table>
<caption>Name Formats</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>
</th>
<th>
New
</th>
<th>
Legacy
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>
User Name
</th>
<td>
username
</td>
<td>
firstname.lastname
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Legacy Name
</th>
<td>
username Resident
</td>
<td>
FirstName LastName
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Default Display
</th>
<td>
username
</td>
<td>
FirstName LastName
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Pretty simple. The one extra thing worth noting is that
firstnamelastname (without the period) has been marked as taken for
all legacy accounts.</p>

<h2>Why Usernames?</h2>

<p>Usernames act as a way to uniquely identify any given avatar, sorta
like UUIDS but human readable. Why is LL ditching the old two name
format? I'm not sure, but probably because having a fixed pool of
last names kinda sucks. Offering a single username is simpler and
offers a lot more flexibility. Most other social media use a single
login name. Twitter, Tumblr, Plurk, Wordpress, Facebook, all give
you a single username. Even older things like Google, MSN, Yahoo,
and AIM -- single username. So why should SL be any different?</p>

<h2>All the Scary Things</h2>

<p>So what happens to your existing Second Life name? Absolutely
nothing. No one else can claim it as a username, because of the
check mentioned above. Simple as that.</p>

<h2>Why the Fuss?</h2>

<p>For some reason, the loss of last names has prompted a huge
username grab by existing users, sorta like domain parking without
the selling the domain for profit bit.</p>

<p>I can understand why people might be concerned. If anyone has
established a brand name in Second Life, it would be nice to snag
the username that matches the brand (or more importantly, prevent
others from snagging the username). In fact, I'm guilty of that
doing exactly that and snagging a few usernames I consider
important.</p>

<p>But, on the flipside, someone has always been able to register a
Second Life name with the name of your store and try to pretend to
be you. Whats the difference between someone trying to be
YourBrandName Resident and YourBrandName Mananguinne or
YourBrandName Jolifaunt? At the end of the day, the person they're
trying to trick has to be smart enough to figure out the actual
owner of the brand. If the victim is new, naive, or just plain
gullible, you can't really win that battle.</p>

<p>So the mad rush for usernames seems a little silly, unless of
course you went and registered YourBrandName LastName for every
single last name available. If you did that, you just have too much
time on your hands.</p>

<p>The one thing I can think of is that usernames might come up first
in search results (the way profiles do now). So an alt with a pick
pointing to your store might not be that bad of an idea. However,
trying to use usernames as generic search keywords goes a bit too
far. Would you click on the user than comes up for the search
"houses" or "clothes"?</p>

<h2>Related to Display Names</h2>

<p>As a side note, the switch to usernames goes hand in hand with the
new display name concept. You can register with boring old
firstnamebirthyear like every other place (e.g. johndoe1950) but
call yourself whatever you want (perhaps "Sir Bedevere the Wise").
And, just like any other place on the internet, someone can pretend
to be someone they are not. Welcome to the interhighway. We have
Nigerian prisoners and lotteries that want to give you money.
Really.</p>

<p>P.S. If you still want old fashioned dual names, the RegAPI seems
to still work. Check out http://slnamewatch.com.</p>

<p>P.P.S. While on the topic of names, there's only one lab. Linden
Lab, that is. Not "Linden Labs". Get it right.</p>
